# To-Do
A simple to do remember in linux terminal wrote in python

The code, on line 15, creates a variable called 'paths'. This is the path of the file where the csv file will be saved. By default it's user's home directory in a hiden file called ".Todo"

I also recomend to add this program ini your /bin directory to make it executable from any directory you are.

##Intall:
###Install the necessary dependencies
```bash
pip install os colorama optparse csv pandas time
```
###Download the repository and copy the the file to the /bin
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mars0r/To-Do
cd To-Do
sudo cp ./to-do.py /bin/to-do
```
